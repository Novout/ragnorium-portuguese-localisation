> This translation is NOT OFFICIAL.

### Installation

> Translation is at an early stage of development.
> So far, there is no steam workshop, so it is necessary to follow the next steps:

1. Copy the content in `src/{version}/English.xml`

2. Browse local game files on Steam

3. Within the `System` folder, replace the current `English.xml` with new content

4. Open the game

> If the file is renamed to another name, such as `PortuguÃªs do Brasil.xml`, the translation will not work.
